<section><h2>Bridgets Argument For the Best Fries</h2>
		<p>This is an argument for the best french fries. I'd have to say, the best french fries are McDonalds. I love all french fries of course but McDonalds fries 
    are cut thin and have a unique taste. 
    I know it is due to the oil they use because McDonalds was my very first job when i was 15 years old. My sister was a McDonalds manager and she hired me as she 
    felt i was a lazy teenager with no focus, lol. 
		My diet today consists of mostly healthy foods but once in a blue moon, i still crave Mickey D's fries. I think they hold a special place in my 
    tastebuds because of my time there in my youth in the 70's. 
	  That being said i still think the crispyness, just the right amount of salt and the skinny cut is what makes them the best fries.</p>
