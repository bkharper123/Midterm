<h2>Lunas Argument For the Best Fries</h2>
		<p>This is an argument for the best french fries. I'd have to say, the best french fries are Wendys. Wendy's fries are always hot and just the right amount 
    of crisy. 
    Unlike McDonald's, they are fresh cut and thick and tasty.I don't believe Mcdonald's fries even compare because they are so thin you can hardly taste them, 
    also they get cold way too fast. 
    If i am craving fresh cut hot and crispy fries, Wendy's is my go too! Just a side note: Wendy's was my Nanny's favorite place to eat when she wanted a fast 
    food treat. She passed away 7yrs ago and whenever i have Wendy's fries, it puts a smile on my face and i feel close to her. </p>
